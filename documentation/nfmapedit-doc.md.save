You can find a thorough explanation of the controls in this tab below:

>!**Select Area**

* Select - *Selected the entire loaded terrain*
* Deselect - *Deselects currently selected terrain*

**Local PVS**

* Build PVS - *Generates a .pvs of the currently loaded terrain (this is for the entire loaded terrain)*
* test PVS - *Toggles PVS rendering to simulate the effect this pvs will have ingame*
* Distance - *??? Needs testing*
* Count - *??? Needs testing*
* Length - *??? Needs testing*
* Camera Offset - *??? Needs testing*
  * Position - *??? Needs testing*
  * Target - *??? Needs testing*
* SAMPLE Point Visible - *??? Needs testing*
* Preview - *??? Needs testing*

**User Sample Point**

* Enable - *Toggles user based PVS points*
* User Build PVS - *Generates PVS based on user points instead of automatic selection*
* All Delete Sample Point - *Removes all user placed points*
* Force Render - *??? Needs testing*

#### Height Editor

This pane allows the user to alter the height of the loaded maps terrain. This includes; Raising/Lowering/Planarizing (leveling out varying terrain heights to a more common height) and flattening (useful for creating plateaus.)

You can find a thorough explanation of the controls in this tab below:

* Raise (F1) - *Raises the terrain by the given size and pressure (intensity)*
* Lower (F2) - *Lowers the terrain by the given size and pressure (intensity)*
* Planarize (F3) - *Planarize (averages) the terrain by the given size and pressure (intensity)*
- Ignore Palanarize Pressure (F4) - *Causes the Planarization of the terrain to ignore the pressure (intensity) currently selected*
* Flatten - *Flattens the terrain (useful to create plateaus)*

#### Tile Editor

This pane allows the users to lay/alter/remove textures on the loaded terrain. This includes the ability to blend up to three unique textures in a variety of blend ratios.

1. Press *(and holding)* the left 'ALT' key, then pressing the 'F' key, then pressing the 'O' key.
2. Click the 'File' menu and then click 'Open Map (O)'
3. Using the 'CTRL' + 'O' key combination
4. Provide proper 'X' and 'Y' map coordinates in the 'Information' group box
4.1 *Example: m009(x)_004(y) or x:9 y:4 is Horizon*
4.2 *No layer is required*
4.3 **# of Additional Maps to Load can load adjacent maps but performance takes a giant hit, it is not recommended to load more than 1 additional map**

## Camera Movement
---

The camera position can be moved in a variety of ways:

#### Keyboard

* `↑` / `Num. Pad 8` - Forward *(x plane)*
* `←` / `Num. Pad 4` - Left *(y plane)*
* `↓` / `Num. Pad 3` - Backward *(x plane)*
* `→` /  `Num. Pad 6` - Right *(y plane)*
* `Shift` - Increases the movement speed of the camera movement through the directional keys

#### Mouse

* Moving across the `x / y` plane
  * Press and hold the `Center / Scroll mouse wheel`and drag  the mouse.
* Panning 
  * Press and hold the `L. Ctrl` key and the `Center / Scroll mouse wheel` and drag the mouse.

*(to increase the camera movement speed hold the `Shift` key)*
